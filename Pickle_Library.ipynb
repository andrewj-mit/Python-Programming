        "* Serialization refers to the process of converting an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk or sent over a network.\n",
        "* The process to converts any kind of python objects (list, dict, etc.) into byte streams (0s and 1s) is called pickling or serialization or flattening or marshalling. \n",
        "* We can converts the byte stream (generated through pickling) back into python objects by a process called as unpickling."

        "* Your program's state data can be saved to disk, so you can continue working on it later on. \n",

        "* The same holds for different versions of Python itself. Unpickling a file that was pickled in a different version of Python may not always work properly, so you have to make sure that you're using the same version and perform an update if necessary. \n",
